# (1) Create a repository.  First, you need to create a new repository on GitHub.  You can do this by clicking on the '+' icon on the top right corner of the GitHub dashboard and selecting 'New Repository.'  Give your repository a name and a description.
# (2) Clone the repository:  Clone the repository to your local machine by running the command git clone [repository URL] in your terminal.
# (3) Create a new branch:  Create a new branch by running the command "git checkout -b [branchname].  Make some changes to a file on this branch and commit them.
# (4) Switch to the main branch:  Switch back to the main branch by running the command git checkout main.
# (5) Make changes to the same file: Make some changes to the same file that you edited in step 3 on the main branch and commit them.
# (6) Merge the two branches:  Merge the branch you created in step 3 with the main branch by running the command git merge [branch-name]
# (7) Resolve the merge conflict:  You will get a merge conflict error since both branches have made changes to the same file.  Open the file in your text editor and you will see the conflicting lines with markers like <<<<<<<HEAD AND >>>>>>> [branch-name].  Edit the file to resolve the conflict and save the changes.
# (8) Add the commit the changes: Once you have resolved the conflict, add and commit the changes by running the commands git add[file-name] and git commit -m "Merge conflict resolved."
# (9) Push the changes to the remote repository by running the commmand git push.
